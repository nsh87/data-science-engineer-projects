# Data Science & Software Engineering Projects
These are some of my favorite data science and software engineering projects
that I have created or contributed to over the past few years.

* [Shiny VM](https://github.com/nsh87/shinyVM) (DevOps, R): a virtual machine
  for quickly creating interactive Shiny apps for R.
* [iPython OLS, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net regression](ipython_notebooks/Regression.ipynb)
  (iPython): performing various regressions and making residual, MSPE, pairwise
  scatter, and QQ plots in Python.
* [iPython PCA & PCR](ipython_notebooks/PCA_and_PCR.ipynb) (iPython):
  demonstration of PCA on images and data, and recovering beta coefficients
  after principle components regression.
* [The Effect of Alcohol Hydration, by Weight](pdfs/Effect_of_Alcohol_on_Hydration.pdf)
  (R, R markdown): a fun report and exploration of literate programming with R
