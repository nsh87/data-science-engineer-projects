# Data Science & Software Engineering Projects
These are some of my favorite data science and software engineering projects
that I have created or contributed to over the past few years.

* [Shiny VM](https://github.com/nsh87/shinyVM) (DevOps, R): a virtual machine
  for quickly creating interactive Shiny apps for R
* [iPython OLS, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net regression](ipython_notebooks/Regression.ipynb):
  performing various regressions and making residual, MSPE, pairwise scatter,
  and QQ plots in Python
* [iPython PCA & PCR](ipython_notebooks/PCA_and_PCR.ipynb): demonstration of PCA
  on images and data, and recovering beta coefficients after principle components
  regression
