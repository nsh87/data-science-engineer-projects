# Data Science & Software Engineering Projects
These are some of my favorite data science and software engineering projects
that I have created or contributed to over the past few years.

* [Shiny VM](https://github.com/nsh87/shinyVM) (DevOps, R): a virtual machine
  for quickly creating interactive Shiny apps for R.
* [iPython OLS, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net regression](ipython_notebooks/Regression.ipynb)
  (iPython): performing various regressions and making residual, MSPE, pairwise
  scatter, and QQ plots in Python.
* [iPython PCA & PCR](ipython_notebooks/PCA_and_PCR.ipynb) (iPython):
  demonstration of PCA on images and data, and recovering beta coefficients
  after principle components regression.
* [The Effect of Alcohol Hydration, by Weight](pdfs/Effect_of_Alcohol_on_Hydration.pdf)
  (R, R markdown): a fun report and exploration of literate programming with R
  markdown.
* [ReceptorMarker website](http://receptormarker.com) (Python, Django, Celery,
  DevOps, R, DBs): a website for high-dimensionality cluster, PCA, sequence
  analysis, and visualization of immunological data, backed by a $50K grant from
  the Gates Foundation.
* [receptormarker](https://github.com/nsh87/receptormarker) (R):
  an open source R package I created for analyzing and visualizing immunological
  data, which also backs receptormarker.com.
* [ReceptorMarkerBackend](https://github.com/nsh87/ReceptorMarkerBackend)
  (DevOps, R, Rserve): the analytical server which hosts the `receptormarker`
  package for receptormarker.com (the frontend is Django-based, but is a private
  repository).
* [MIMIC II VM](https://github.com/nsh87/mimic-ii-vm) (DevOps, PostgreSQL):
  creates a VM and loads the popular MIMIC II clinical data set into a Postgres
  DB on the VM.
* [EHRcorral](https://github.com/nsh87/ehrcorral) (Python): an open source
  Python package for probabilistically matching same-patient electronic medical
  records using lexical analysis, phonemic compression, field weighting.
